         <p> India's Commerce Minister, Piyush Goyal, is scheduled to meet with Elon Musk in the United States next week to discuss Tesla's plans to enter the Indian market. The meeting will focus on setting up a factory in India, manufacturing a $24,000 car, sourcing components, and establishing charging infrastructure. They will also likely discuss India's proposed policy to reduce import taxes on EVs for automakers committed to local manufacturing. The meeting aims to ensure that talks between India and Tesla are progressing in the right direction.</p>

         <p> The US Development Finance Corporation (DFC) on Wednesday announced it would provide $553 million for Colombo West International Terminal Pvt Ltd (CWIT), in which Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone (APSEZ) is a majority stakeholder with 51 per cent.
            It is part-owned by Sri Lanka’s John Keells Holdings and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority.</p>

        <h4> India's total tax receipts likely to exceed Budget Estimate in FY24</h4>

         <p> With the present momentum in direct tax and goods and services tax (GST) collections expected to sustain in the coming months, India’s total tax receipts in 2023-24 could exceed the Budget Estimate by a “considerable margin”, according to government sources.<br>
            These expectations, however, are based on the preliminary assessment as part of the government’s pre-Budget exercise. A clearer picture would emerge from data for advance tax payments for the third quarter in December, and GST collections for the April-December period.<br>
            Even as pre-Budget meetings are taking place at North Block, policymakers are still assessing tax collection projections for next financial year (2024-25).</p>
