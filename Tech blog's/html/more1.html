The advanced feature, among others in the pipeline, seeks to provide a more personalised experience, revolutionising the way users engage with content and receive recommendations.<br><br>Elon Musk has unveiled a new addition to the platform previously known as Twitter, now rebranded as "X." This latest feature is driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and is part of a larger series of innovations intended to transform X into an all-encompassing application.<br><br>Musk made the official announcement, stating, "AI-based 'See similar' posts feature is rolling out now on X." This newly introduced feature represents just one aspect of the expansive suite of features that X is set to unveil over time.<br><br>The idea behind this AI-based "See similar" feature was initially discussed by Musk during an internal meeting at X on October 26. He shared insights into various forthcoming features being developed by the company.<br><br>"We have a multitude of features in the pipeline. Furthermore, we are diligently working on enhancing our search functionality, aiming for a semantic search. This means that when you enter search terms, the system will understand your intent and provide relevant text, images, and videos," Musk explained.<br><br>Musk emphasized that X aims to transition its entire system to be AI-based, including the "recommended for you" posts. He elaborated on the approach, describing a system where user preferences are mapped within a vector space, and each post is similarly positioned in this space. By correlating these vector spaces, the platform can present users with content that is most likely to be of interest to them, effectively revolutionizing the current heuristics.<br><br>In addition to this AI feature, X recently introduced audio and video calling functionalities to the platform. Users can now engage in high-quality audio and video calls within the X ecosystem. While premium subscribers have the privilege of initiating such calls, all users can receive incoming audio and video calls. These features are initially available on iOS and are expected to soon extend to the Android platform, enhancing the communication capabilities of X.
<br><br>With these innovations, X continues its evolution into a comprehensive and AI-driven application, promising an enriched user experience and more dynamic communication tools for its growing user base.</p>
