         <p> AI in gaming refers to the integration of artificial intelligence techniques and technologies into video games to create more dynamic, responsive, and immersive gameplay experiences. It involves programming computer-controlled characters (non-player characters or NPCs) and entities within the game environment to exhibit intelligent behaviors, make decisions, and interact with the player and the game world in a lifelike manner. Think of it as a virtual mind for the characters and components in a video game, breathing life into the digital realm and making it interactive, almost as if you're engaging with real entities.</p>
